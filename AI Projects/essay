I am interested in this position because of my ever-growing love and passion for computer science. Since 6th grade, I have been teaching myself to code and have developed a solid foundation in computer science. My experiences as a member of my school's robotics team, the leader of the software development group in my school's Technology Student Association (TSA) club and being the team lead have equipped me with the skills and knowledge to contribute effectively to the CS4All initiative. Additionally, my work for developing an app for the non-profit Gokul Bhajan and Vedic Studies using Flutter demonstrates my commitment to using technology for social good. Through these experiences, I have learned many valuable skills and concepts, such as HTML, Dart, Flutter, Python, SQL, and Web Development. I have also learned how to work effectively in teams, communicate clearly, debug errors, and research solutions. However, I know that there is still much more to learn and discover in computer science, and that is why I want to join the CS4All program.


This internship will benefit my educational and career goals by providing me with an opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge in a real-world setting, learning from experienced educators and developers and learning to work in a group enviornment. Participating in this program will help me build a strong foundation for my future academic and professional pursuits, including my aspiration to pursue a degree in computer science. Furthermore, this experience will allow me to leverage my diverse experiences in computer science, app development, robotics, and leadership to contribute to the CS4All initiative.

The CS4All program is an initiative that aims to ensure that all students have access to high-quality computer science education, regardless of their background or location. The program offers a variety of opportunities for students to learn from experts, collaborate with peers, and apply their skills to real-world projects. By joining the CS4All program, I hope to expand my knowledge and skills in computer science, explore new topics and technologies that interest me, and prepare myself for college-level courses and future careers in STEM fields.
To me, CS4All represents computer science education for everyone, ensuring that students from all backgrounds have equal access to the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the rapidly evolving digital world. It is about breaking down barriers and promoting diversity in the field, empowering historically marginalized groups to participate in and contribute to the growth of technology and innovation. My involvement in various computer science-related activities, such as app development, robotics, and leadership in the TSA club, demonstrates my commitment to making computer science education more inclusive and accessible to all students, ultimately helping me and everyone around me become the best versions of ourselves. By joining CS4All, I hope to not only improve my technical skills and knowledge but also develop my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I also hope to connect with other students who share my passion for computer science and learn from their perspectives and experiences. Moreover, I hope to use what I learn to create meaningful projects that can address real-world issues and make a positive difference in my community and beyond.
